# Adoptera ett husdjur

The Adoptera Pet project is a web application that aims to connect potential pet adopters with animal shelters and rescue organizations. The project provides a platform where users can search for available pets based on their preferences and location, view detailed information about each pet, and initiate the adoption process.
